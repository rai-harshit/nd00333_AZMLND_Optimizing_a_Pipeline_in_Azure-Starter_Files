# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
This dataset contains data related to a marketing campaign, conducted over phone calls, by a bank. The goal is to predict whether or not a customer subscribed to a term deposit. In order to predict that, we take into account various characteristics of the customers some of which are age, martial status, education and type of job.

The best performing model on the bank marketing dataset was the VotingEnsemble model which had an accuracy of about 91.68%. This model was created by the Azure AutoML tool in its 38th iteration. This model was slightly more accurate than the LogisticRegression model which has accuracy of about 91.31% and was optimized using the Hyperdrive tool.

## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**

## Proof of cluster clean up
**The compute cluster was cleaned up (deleted) using the relevant command from within the Jupyter notebook. The same can be confirmed from the image below.**
